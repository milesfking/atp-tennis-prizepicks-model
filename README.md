# ATP Tennis Tour Prediction Model

Using data sourced from [Jeff Sackmann's ATP Tennis Rankings Database](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp), my goal is to create a machine learning model to predict the outcomes of matches on the ATP (Association of Tennis Profssionals) Tour. Specifically, the response variable of interest is the number of fantasy points scored by a given player on the popular daily fantasy sports site PrizePicks. Utilizing data from over 50,000 ATP matches between 1997 and 2021, I aim to build a probabilitstic machine learning model to increase my odds of accurately predicting whether a player will overperform or underperform the value set by PrizePicks.

Success will instead be evaluated by placing hypothetical over/under bets and recording the results on an Excel spreadhseet.
